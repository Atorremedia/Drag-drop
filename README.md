# Dropzone project in React

This project was built in React and CSS by August Oll√© Corbella to take part in the BCN Inclusive Coding Hackhaton.


### `Main Goals`

The objective was to develop a simple yet working dropzone. Any file or group of files can be dragged and dropped. Users can also click in the box to open the file browser and choose files this way. Uploaded files are listed below, along with each file size.
### `Technology used`

The application was built using React and the React Dropzone library (https://react-dropzone.js.org/). It can be used with the useDropzone hook.
### `Future improvements`

Future improvements on the application include:

- Implement color changing on the dropzone while dragging over.
- Show dropped images on the same page.
